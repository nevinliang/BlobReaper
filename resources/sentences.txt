a glittering soul stone is not enough
that was how he came to win a million dollars
he quietly entered the museum as the super bowl started
the delicious aroma was ruined by cigarette smoke
i would be delighted if the sea were full of cucumber juice
life is a bowl of soup and i am a fork

i can't see when I close my eyes

i survived the great toilet paper scare of 2020

You never know what you have until you clean your room

my six pack is protected by a layer of fat
